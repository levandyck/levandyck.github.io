Hi, and welcome to my website!

I'm Lenny, a second-year PhD candidate in Cognitive Computational Neuroscience at JLU Giessen, working with [Katharina Dobs](https://www.katharinadobs.com/) and [Martin Hebart](https://hebartlab.com/).

In my research, I investigate how the brain transforms sensory input into meaningful representations. I'm particularly fascinated by functionally selective areas that perform specialized computations to solve this complex task. With a foundation in cognitive neuroscience and a growing passion for machine learning, I combine neuroimaging and computational modeling to uncover how the brain makes sense of the world around us.

When not doing science, I like to travel the planet in a campervan.
